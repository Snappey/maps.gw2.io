<p-dialog header="About" [(visible)]="this.visible" [style]="{width: '50vw'}">
  <div>
    Created because I like scrolling around on maps when I'm wasting time and there were none for Guild Wars 2 that I enjoyed using.
    Little things like (hopefully) smooth performance when panning around but still being able to see all the relevant information.

  <div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">Marker Interaction</h4>
    Clicking a marker to copy its chat link to your clipboard or
    double clicking to be taken to the wiki. Along with increased detail on major cities such as Lion's Arch and Arborstone.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">Direct Links</h4>
    You can also link others directly to a location on the map, look here is <a href="/tyria#-257.87109375,371.3515625,7" target="_blank">Claw Island</a>. (And <i>maybe soon</i> support for chat links)
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">Drawing</h4>
    Draw in the same style as in-game by holding the right click, and enjoy non-invasive schedules for the currently active events for each expansion.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">Live Map</h4>
    There is support for a "Live Map" (requires an API key), allowing you to see yourself, guild, everyone or a special mix of all the above as markers on the map including in WvW. This includes segmentation to prevent leaking your position to anyone who shouldn't know about it. Currently it's a private BlishHud module that has not been released, if you're interested in trying it out let me know.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">Finally</h4>
    Any suggestions, issues, or feedback feel free to open an issue on GitHub, find me in my guilds Discord below or send me a mail in-game.
